# Pregnancy Appointment Calculator


## Project Description 
This Python 3.8.5 program calculates the next appointments for a pregnant person. All appointments come at specific stages during the pregnancy and depending on each stage, the frequency of appointments will also change; this calculator finds all the dates for the appointments with each stage and frequency considered.

Python 3.8.5 was used so as to learn its basic syntax and semantics through the operations of an appointment calculator. 

A challenge that came about was converting the calulations into dates instead of just mere integers. The datetime library and the timedelta function helped in manipulating the dates in the calculations.
